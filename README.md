# Refactoring Summary

## Overview
This refactors the original `PaymentService` to improve testability, maintainability and to align to the SOLID principles.

## Key changes

### 1. DI
- Original: Direct creation of data stores within `PaymentService` using `new`
- Refactored: Introduced DI via constructor parameters
  - Created `IDataStoreFactory` to handle data store creation
  - Created `IPaymentValidatorFactory` for validator instantiation

### 2. Single Responsibility Principle
- Original: The `PaymentService` handled validation logic, data access, and business rules

- Refactored: Separated into focused components:
  - `PaymentService`: Orchestrates the payment flow
  - `IPaymentValidator` Handle payment scheme validation
  - `DataStoreFactory`: Manages data store selection
  - `ConfigurationProvider`: Handles configuration access

### 3. Open/Closed Principle
- Original: The Switch in `MakePayment` requires a code change to add any new payment schemes

- Refactored: Into Strategy pattern with validators:
  - `BasePaymentValidator`: Abstract base with common validation
  - `BacsPaymentValidator`: BACS-specific rules
  - `FasterPaymentsValidator`: Faster Payments rules
  - `ChapsPaymentValidator`: CHAPS-specific rules
  - New payment schemes can be added without modifying existing code

### 4. Interface Segregation
- Original: No interfaces for data stores
- Refactored: To include interfaces
  - `IAccountDataStore` interface for all data stores
  - `IConfigurationProvider` for configuration access
  - `IPaymentValidator` for validation strategies

### 5. Improved Testability
- Original: Hard dependencies made unit testing difficult

- Refactored: To make unit testing simpler
  - All dependencies are mockable via interfaces
  - Clear test boundaries

### 6. Code Organization
- Created logical folder structure: Before moving to seporate projects
  ```
  /Configuration - Configuration management
  /Data         - Data access layer
  /Factories    - Factory patterns
  /Services     - Business logic
  /Types        - Domain models
  /Validators   - Validation logic
  ```

### 7. Null Safety & Early Returns
- Added null checks at method entry points
- Early return pattern to reduce nesting
- Clear failure reasons in results

## Test Coverage

### Test Infrastructure:
- Test Data Builders: Builders for creating test data quickly and saves code duplication
  - `AccountBuilder`: Flexible account creation
  - `PaymentRequestBuilder`: Request generation with Bogus library
